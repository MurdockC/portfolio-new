                  <h3>Good Day,</h3>
                  <hr>
                  <p>
                     I submit here my resume in consideration for the position of Jr Communication Designer.<br />
                     My name is Caleb Murdock, and while preparing this letter for you I remembered an article I had read a little over a year ago.
                     Luckily, after a quick Google search, I found it! The title:  "How to Get a Job at InVision" much to my chagrin however, it did not conclude with
                     an explicit checklist or any apparent cheat codes to enter in the application form Captcha.
                     Therefore, I will resort to the archaic method of actually showing you how I, Caleb Murdock, would be a worthwhile addition to the InVision team.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I believe that I can begin making valuable and meaningful contributions to your team through my attention to detail, and developed design skills.
                     I am adept in Illustrator, Photoshop, XD, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                     My background includes agency and freelance design experience, with a history of print, packaging and digital design projects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Presently I am a Web Developer for Ramsey Mediaworks, I have worked on nationwide
                     and international marketing and advertising campaigns for global brands and companies,
                     including Ashley Distribition, McLane, Crete Carrier, Landstar, and Kenan Advantage Group, as well as a host of local and and mid-size businesses.
                     Working with logistics recruiters to increase driver applicant conversions.
                     Along with this, I've been able to research and bring new findings and technologies to my department resulting in a project turn-around time reduction
                     from 4 day to around 3-4 hours.
                     I believe the combination of my skills and  imagination will allow me to start making advancements to your company in
                     several mediums and technical platforms your marketing/design efforts require.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     In addition, my many years as a human-being allows me to play well with others.
                     This is including, but not limited to: smiling, cordial conversation, emotional intelligence, and endless empathy.
                     After 3 years of articulating design desicions to truck drivers, I've learned to be clear and succinct and most importantly: kind, all of which I believe will be key
                     to working remote for InVision.
                     I'm a internally motivated, eternally curious and a gracious recipient of guidence and instruction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I have a proven track record with executing design initiatives.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I believe my skill set aligns perfectly with the needs of InVision
                     Thank you for reviewing my credentials.
                     I look forward to learning more about the opportunity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Sincerely,<br />
