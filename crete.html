                   <h1>Crete Carrier - Landing Page</h1>
                   <h4>Role: Web Designer</h4>
                   <hr>
                   <p><span class="project__Property">About:</span> Crete Carrier has grown to one of the nation’s largest, privately held trucking companies.  They operate more than 5,000 tractors and over 13,000 trailers throughout the continental United States.  Naturally their recruitment team stays busy and they asked us to come on board and boost their application nummbers. </p>
                  <br>
                   <p><span class="project__Property">Problem Solved:</span> They weren't getting enough drivers through other sources.  Many of their trucks sat empty, which for them ment money that could be made was sitting in parking lots across the united states. </p>
                  <br>
                   <p><span class="project__Property">Solution:</span> To create  a landing page according to conversion design best practices in accordance with the brand guidelines they provided.</p>
                  <h3>Process</h3>
                   <p>I started by identifying their routes of communication and the flow of applications.  What tools they used, and flow of getting a driver hired.</p>
                   <img class="project__Photo--fw" src="dist/assets/images/sites/site8.png" alt="">
                    <div class="photo-desc">Initial sketches from early brainstorming of UI</div>
                   <p class="project__Text">Our team has dealt with previous cases like this.  from our previous experience in over 100 other cases we knew that through our sources and throughout driver culture nealrly 87% of our audience would be on a mobile device.  This was an easy push for us to design with a mobile-first mentallity. </p>
                  <br>
                   <p class="project_Text">I stayed with as few call-to-actions as possible.  I needed to integrate their ATS as well as way for the user to connect through phone and email.  We also worked to integrate a third party application to emediately call both parties and connect them for instant drive/recruiter contact, which we saw a great increase in hires from.</p>
                  <br>
                 <p class="prohect__Text">We decided to place a menu bar at the bottom containing two links to anchors containing pertinant driver info and our two CTA's. One to call and one to fill out the short form. </p>
                  <br>
                 <p class="prohect__Text">In the end sticking to the brand guielines and uplifting conversion based principles, we were able to provide a 100.8% growth in application subittions and a 30% in short application conversions within the first year.  We were happy to help the recruitment department fill their trucks and are excited to see an american company thrive.</p>
