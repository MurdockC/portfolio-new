                   <h4>Role: UI Designer</h4>
                   <hr>
                   <p><span class="project__Property">About:</span>
                     Neighbor Connect is a program developed by Water Gardens,
                     a local organization that focuses on homeless needs and
                     rehabilitation.  Seeing the usefulness that the program had
                     brought to them in the past in their own work, they decided
                     to explore options to expand the program to include a wider user base.
               </p>
                  <br>
                   <p><span class="project__Property">Problem Solved:</span>
                     The program was based on the idea of neighbors helping neighbors.
                     They wanted literal neighborhoods to be able to see the needs
                     of their neighbors and fulfill them quickly and safely.
                     When they came to my team at Ramsey the entire program was
                     being run off of hand written notes, text messages, and phone calls.</p>
                  <br>
                   <p><span class="project__Property">Solution:</span>
                     To create a centralized place for new and existing members
                     to have access to all functionality and communications.</p>
                  <h3>Process</h3>
                   <p>We started by identifying our four separate types of users,
                     we did this by listing out our needs and the hierarchy of
                     the program, this gave us personas for our four main user
                     views:  our benefactor neighbor, our neighbor in need, and
                     admin for local support, and a super admin for global
                     supervision and support. These personas would be the
                     pillars for the strategy and architecture of the site.</p>

                    <div class="photo-desc">Initial sketches from early brainstorming of UI</div>
                   <p class="project__Text">Since our user base would be utilizing
                     location-based-services to connect with their neighbors,
                     and the fact that mobile users constitute +-60% of the
                     internet users,  we took an educated guess that it would
                     be heavily used by those on mobile devices.  This is a large
                     reason we implemented a mobile-first design. </p>

                   <div class="photo-desc">Early Idiation of what the app could look like utilizing brand colors as the primary pallette.</div>

                   <p class="project_Text">We needed to match the app to the current program branding.
                      We relied heavily on custom icons and using the brand color palette
                      to accent the simple layout and create a unique look.
                      We strove to include only that which was necessary and stray away from obtrusive design.</p>

                 <p class="project_Text">After many ideations, we came to the design
                    we felt like was best
                 suited for the need.  It championed intuitive gestures and common
                  design patterns to bring an interface that felt very natural to the user.
                  upon completion of the design, we had a clean handoff to the company 
                  executing the heavy lifting development.

                   We were able to contain the functions of a
